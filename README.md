# About me

I'm Alondra Rubio, a Data Scientist with a background in computer systems engineering and 8+ years of professional experience — first in digital marketing, and now in data science and analytics. **I specialize in extracting insights, building predictive models, and creating data solutions that support strategic decision-making.**

My technical toolkit includes **Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning** techniques such as classification, clustering, time series forecasting, and recommender systems. I’ve led projects involving customer segmentation, behavioral analysis, data visualization, and automated reporting pipelines.

Beyond tools and models, I bring strong soft skills: **I’m a detail-oriented, results-driven professional who communicates clearly across teams**. I thrive in collaborative, remote environments where curiosity, adaptability, and continuous learning are valued.

What sets me apart is my ability to combine business understanding with technical precision — translating data into real impact.
